# RasaSupportBot (V1 - Broken Demo)

This is a deliberately broken demo chatbot for portfolio purposes. It simulates a real-world support bot with known performance and quality issues, which will be fixed in V2.

## Features (V1)
- Handles only 3 intents: greet, ask_hours, ask_refund
- Weak NLU: Only 2â€“3 ambiguous examples per intent
- No fallback response: fails silently on unknown input
- Simulates slow responses (2s delay)
- No conversation logging or tracking
- No context memory (no slots or forms)
- Very generic, low-quality answers

## Known Issues (to fix in V2)
- Poor intent recognition due to tiny, ambiguous training set
- No fallback or error handling for unknown input
- Slow response time (intentional delay)
- No logs or analytics
- Cannot remember user context or previous turns
- Answers are not helpful or detailed
- Minimal code and configuration
